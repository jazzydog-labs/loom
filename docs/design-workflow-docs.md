# Document desired workflows

## Rationale
The project currently lacks a central description of how Loom is intended to be used day to day. Providing a short
workflow overview will help newcomers understand the common commands and how they fit together.

## Proposed Changes
- Add a new `docs/workflows.md` file outlining the typical Loom workflow.
- Link the new page from `README.md` so users can discover it quickly.

## Alternatives Considered
The documentation could live entirely in the README, but splitting it keeps the quick-start short while allowing
deeper explanations elsewhere.
