# Implement ShellGateway

Implement ShellGateway with concurrency limits for shell command execution.

## Tasks:
- [x] Create ShellGateway class in infra/
- [x] Implement command execution with concurrency control
- [x] Add timeout and resource management
- [x] Write unit tests
- [x] Create comprehensive demo
- [x] Update skeleton test
- [x] Add to justfile

## Implementation Summary:

### ShellGateway (`src/infra/shell_gateway.py`)
- **Security Modes**: Safe, Restricted, and Permissive execution modes
- **Command Validation**: Automatic security checks with configurable command allow/block lists
- **Concurrency Control**: ThreadPoolExecutor with semaphore for resource management
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts with automatic process cleanup
- **Path Restrictions**: Sandboxed execution with allowed directory paths
- **Pipeline Support**: Chain commands with output passing between stages
- **Context Manager**: Automatic resource cleanup
- **Convenience Methods**: Built-in support for common operations (ls, cat, grep, find, git, python)

### Security Features:
- **Command Whitelisting**: Predefined safe commands (ls, cat, echo, git, python, etc.)
- **Dangerous Command Blocking**: Blocks rm, sudo, kill, shutdown, etc.
- **Pattern Detection**: Prevents command injection ($(, `, &&, ||, ;, |, >, etc.)
- **Path Validation**: Ensures execution only in allowed directories
- **Process Cleanup**: Automatic termination of timeout/hanging processes

### Concurrency & Resource Management:
- **Max Concurrent**: Configurable limit on simultaneous processes
- **Semaphore Control**: Thread-safe process execution
- **Active Process Tracking**: Monitor and manage running processes
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean termination with resource cleanup

### Test Coverage: 88%
- 506 lines of test code covering all major functionality
- Security validation tests
- Concurrency control tests
- Timeout and error handling tests
- Pipeline and convenience method tests

### Demo Features:
- **Killer Feature Section**: Shows security validation preventing dangerous commands
- **Comprehensive Examples**: All 14 major features demonstrated with real commands
- **Real Output**: Actual command execution showing practical usage
- **Error Demonstrations**: Shows how security errors are handled

The ShellGateway provides a secure, controlled foundation for shell operations in Loom with automatic security validation, concurrency control, and comprehensive error handling.
